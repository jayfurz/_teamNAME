Today and tomorrow going to finish modules and logic blocks
Tuesday will be able to connect everything together 
Verify that the dataflows work through testbenches.

Adam and Brandon will work on implementation of modules these next couple days
Aymaan and Justin will work on working on better verification implementation.

on Tuesday we should be able to implement everything together and be able to test it as well.
implement into fpga board.
