Created REGfile. just used the mem_twoport example.
we changed the 2bit array to 32x64 and we set the two outputs equal to mem at the addresses provided by ra1,ra2.

Want to make testbench for the regfile:
set we=1;
set ra1= 0 and ra2=1; => rd1==0 and rd2= 0;
set wa=2 and wd=10 ;

set we=0;
ra1 = 2 and ra2 =3; =>rd1 and rd2 =0;
set wa=0 and wd=25 ;

set we=1
==>rd1 = 10 and rd2 =0

set we =0
ra1=2 and ra2=0
wa=1 wd=50;

set we=1;
==>rd1=10 and rd2=25;
wa=1 wd=50

set we=0;

using these conditions we will check if the outputs are equal to the ones we have theorized. 
We are simply testing the clock and the registers in this function.
wanna see if when writing verification file, if we have to reassign each 


trying to run tests, the outputs are not changing, going to try to manually change variables on regfile.
looks like the simulation responds, need to edit the testbench code and debug.
